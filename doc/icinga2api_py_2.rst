icinga2api\_py layer 2
=======================

This selection of modules builds the second "layer" of this library. See :ref:`doc-structure` about layers.

While the first layer is mainly about constructing a request, this layer is more about receiving a response from the
Icinga API, process it and make all of its information as accessible as possible.
